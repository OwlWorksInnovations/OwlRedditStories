# Production Readiness Roadmap (CLAUDE AI GENERATED)

## üö® Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Add try-catch blocks around all file operations
- [ ] Add try-catch blocks around all API calls (Reddit, YouTube, TTS)
- [ ] Add try-catch blocks around all subprocess calls (FFmpeg)
- [ ] Validate required files/directories exist before processing
- [ ] Implement graceful failure recovery mechanisms

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Create `config.py` with all settings
- [ ] Move hard-coded paths to environment variables
- [ ] Create separate configs for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Remove magic numbers (font sizes, bitrates, etc.)

### Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Replace all `print()` with proper `logging` module
- [ ] Add structured logging (JSON format)
- [ ] Create log rotation policy
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection

## üîß Code Quality Issues (Priority 2)

### Function Refactoring
- [ ] Fix `subtitiles()` typo ‚Üí `create_subtitles()`
- [ ] Break down large functions into smaller ones
- [ ] Separate concerns (video processing, audio processing, upload)
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions

### Data Validation
- [ ] Validate JSON structure in `posts.json`
- [ ] Check required fields exist before processing
- [ ] Add type hints to all functions
- [ ] Validate audio/video file integrity

### Security & Dependencies
- [ ] Encrypt credential storage
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Sanitize subprocess inputs
- [ ] Update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements (Priority 3)

### Service Separation
- [ ] Create separate modules for each responsibility
- [ ] Implement job queue system (Celery/RQ)
- [ ] Replace JSON files with proper database
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### Monitoring & Operations
- [ ] Add application metrics
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Add automated testing

## üìã Daily Checklist Template

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Check error logs from previous run
- [ ] Verify all required directories exist
- [ ] Check API rate limits and quotas
- [ ] Ensure background videos and sounds are available

### After Each Session
- [ ] Review and clean up temporary files
- [ ] Check upload success rates
- [ ] Update progress on roadmap items
- [ ] Commit and push code changes

## üéØ Weekly Goals

### Week 1: Foundation
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Set up proper logging system
- Create configuration management

### Week 2: Code Quality
- Refactor main functions
- Add input validation
- Implement type hints

### Week 3: Architecture
- Separate concerns into modules
- Implement database storage
- Add monitoring basics

### Week 4: Production Features
- Add secrets management
- Implement rate limiting
- Create deployment process

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Can do today)
- [ ] Fix the `subtitiles` typo
- [ ] Add basic logging to replace print statements
- [ ] Create a simple config.py file
- [ ] Add file existence checks before processing
- [ ] Wrap main operations in try-catch blocks
