      "submission_post": "I (M25) have been with my fiancée Sofia (F24) since we were 20. She’s Ukrainian, and a few years back she got really close to my younger second cousin Alina (F18). Alina’s mixed Russian-American, and when they met at thanksgiving, they clicked. They like cooking together, speaking the same language, and going to church sometimes. After Alina’s mom passed away, she’s been spending a lot more time with us. Her Russian side of the family doesn’t live anywhere nearby, and there's not a big slavic community where we live.   \n  \nSo here’s the situation. Last weekend, Sofia and Alina drove out to this little bakery a couple hours away for some borodinsky bread. While they were gone, I had some of my friends over to watch the game. When the girls came back, I introduced Alina to everyone, making a point to say she's my younger cousin. She said hi, all normal. Then the storm outside picks up and we lose the sports channel. We all sat down for dinner, and one of my friends, Matt (27) makes this creepy comment directed at Alina something along the lines of \"Forget the game, I could just watch her walk around all night\"\n\nThe whole table just went silent. Alina froze. She looked so uncomfortable and awkward. And like a minute ago she was talking about being in college. \n\nI said \"What the fuck did you just say? That’s disgusting she’s 18\" He said something like \"that's legal, why are you so worked up?\" I told him point-blank \"You’re not welcome in my home anymore. Get out\" I may have also muttered something about him being a creep, but honestly at that point I didn’t care. I did also stand up and like wait for him to leave. \n\nAnyways, he left. The vibe recovered quickly everyone had a great time. A bit later, Matt puts on the chat that I publicly humiliated him for no reason, and that I was an awful friend who used this as an excuse to kick him out. He says I could have just said Alina's 18. \n\nI don't really think I over reacted. Alina looked super uncomfortable. She lost her mom recently and has been relying on us a lot. The last thing I want is her associating my house with some creepy older guy trying to hit on her. Sofia told me straight up I did the right thing, and that if we hadn’t kicked him out, the message to Alina would have been that it’s okay for men to make her uncomfortable. \n\nMatt also said I was being overprotective, and that plenty of guys would have hit on her before. TBF, I didn't like the guy that much even before, but he's apart of my group so I did have to invite them. I would have rather not. AITA? I can see how saying all of that was a bit... embarrassing for him, like unnecessarily so. Also, if another of my friends had said it I may have been a bit less harsh, idk. \n\n",

We suggested other costumes (I suggested being her lady-in-waiting, but she was very against that and they suggested I be a court jester or wizard but I would really like to wear a dress/something girly). By the end of the conversation it seemed like everyone was getting a little frustrated and my friend told me I could wear whatever I want and that it was my choice.

So I have this dog for less than 48 hours and find an adult flea. No big deal, he came from a wooded area. If hes on the proper meds, he bites and dies like with my dogs. Cool. I found more, I found eggs, I found live teenagers. I have since medicated the dog, bathed the dog 3x times in flea shampoo. Which is hard, he hates it. J has called his vet for the meds so I got to go pick them up for him, but I asked the front desk when his last dose was, she said 3 months ago. Hes been off medication for 2 months. Im furious at this point and tell him he has 24h to find another place for the dog or get it, trying to be gracious. He argues with me and tells me he has no one, and has subsequently spent all of his money and cant get home right now...\nSide note: I myself have immune issues, and I dont know if my current symptoms are stress or Im also allergic to fleas.",

He then gave the example, “should I creat an agreement that you’d be responsible for rent if something happened?” I replied “yeah, it’s called a lease… which I signed” We went to bed without speaking and haven’t brought up the conversation again. Am I the asshole for asking him to sign an agreement he would still have to pay his part if anything happened? ",

      "submission_post": "My girlfriend of two years (37F) decided to ride her bike while drunk last weekend, got into an accident and broke her arm. It's (by any measure) a minor break and it requires a (by any measure) minor surgery to fix it. I've been very supportive and very nice to her the last few days, even though I'm really (more than a bit) mad at her for riding her bike while drunk. She is having the surgery next week. I have a business trip coming up next week, which I've already rescheduled to avoid going away during the surgery. But the surgery date has now changed to the exact date I rescheduled my business trip to. She really wants me to stay for the surgery, and of course I want to, but this is a very important trip and my job pays for the vast majority of our expenses. Sometimes I feel like she has no respect for that. If I cancel or reschedule the trip again, it will really negatively effect my reputation at work and will be a big missed opportunity. If it were another circumstance, like a totally unpreventable accident or a more serious illness of course I would make every effort to be there. But saying to my colleagues \"sorry, my girlfriend rode her bike drunk and broke her arm so I can't go to the very important meeting\" doesn't seem like a good look. She's really making me feel bad about it. AITA for thinking, as a 37yo adult, she should live with the consequences of her stupid action and not make me feel bad about it and jeopardize my job and our overall well-being?",

Last Sunday I cooked for my flatmates as a last supper before moving out. I informed my flatmates in WhatsApp group that I would cook dinner for us, all were invited, and asked which date everyone would be home. I also said I would invite 2 friends (ex-flatmates) if they were free. One confirmed. None of us have any dietary restrictions, so I planned a 5-course non-vegetarian meal for 6 people (4 FM, me, and the CF). I brought groceries and wine beforehand and prepped the starter, freezing it so I wouldn’t have to rush on the day.\n\nWe live in Germany, so everything is closed on Sunday, including supermarkets. On Saturday at noon I started marinating chicken and preparing dessert.\n\nDev (M25) DM’d me asking if his girlfriend could join. I know She’s vegetarian. So, I said it was fine but I hadn’t planned anything vegetarian except salad, bread, etc., and dessert already had egg (6 rice puddings for each of us in separate bowls). He said she could eat the chicken sauce with bread.  I said that’s fine. I also wanted to make something for her but I was tired and didn’t want to go buy groceries again walking 20 mins so I didn’t have much stuff at home we usually buy food only for 1 week as supermarkets are close from home, plus I was going on vacation next week so just wanted to finish whatever food I had.\n\nEverything went well on Sunday. I started cooking at 14:00 for 18:00. Flatmates helped set the table; I declined help in the kitchen. Everyone arrived on time, we had music, and started dinner: starter, soup, main course, salad, dessert.\n\nBut Dev’s GF declined appetiser and soup and asked if she can start with salad instead. She had to wait for main course as we were finishing our first 2 courses. As the main course was still in the oven I kept it warm there. And I didn’t want to go kitchen again to serve her food separately. I thought it would be great to all finish together. We later started with main course and she had just gravy, from the main course with bread. Which I also felt bad about but I couldn’t help with that as it was already agreed. She didn’t complain at all. We finished our meal with dessert which was again for 6 of us, but her boyfriend and I shared with her. She asked if we want to have espresso after dinner, we all said yes and she made it for us.\n\nAfter dinner, all 7 of us sat on the balcony with wine. Later the couple went inside, and Fabio said: “The food was great, but you should’ve made something for her so she has more than bread and sauce.” I reminded him I had informed them beforehand. We argued a bit; I was tired, had spent effort and money, and wanted good memories. He said people might agree to the food but you should respect dietary preferences.

      "submission_post": "So I (18 M) have been going to a music school for 11 years now. For 6 years (ever since I switched schools and had to start commuting there) I've had the piano lesson (PL for this post) at the same time - Wednesday 19:00 to 19:45 and before that I've had ensemble class (EC). I had a different teacher for EC before, but for the last 2 years (the old one retired) I go to the EC of the same teacher I have for PL. It is important to note that both of those ECs were at the same time - 18:15 to 19:00. \n\nAt the EC there is this one girl (17 F - let's call her Emma) - she also happens to be my classmate, so we have the same timetable at school. Our teacher is in my town only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Emma had her PL on Tuesday right after school if she took the bus. This year, she suddenly needs to have the PL after EC. \n\nI live in the same town where the music school is, but I live at the other end so if I take some shortcuts through fields and forests I can get there in 20 minutes (those shortcuts are unusable in winter tho) so it usually takes around 30 minutes. Emma lives in neighboring town and it takes her around an hour to go on foot, but her mother ALWAYS picks her up, so it takes her like 4 minutes by car. \n\nThis year, her brother has some kind of sports class in some other town, so after the EC ends, she has to wait for 20 minutes for her mother to pick her brother up and then her. For some reason, both Emma and her mother can't deal with this. She's a stay-at-home mom and has no problem picking her up both of those days so she gets to the music school and back in 10 minutes. For me, it takes an hour. \n\nLong story short, I refused to switch with her for my own comfort. We agreed with our music teacher that I'll have the PL at the same time like always last year and I am not willing to switch with her. When her mother found out, she started freaking out and went straight to our teacher. They are friends so suddenly there are 3 people pushing me to switch even though it makes zero sense to me. I told her I'd rather quit but the teacher needs me there because I'm basically carrying the EC. \n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole?",

That night, after drinking, my SIL confronted me in front of my mom. She accused me of attacking her parenting. I stayed calm and said I had not meant it that way.

And we sent our invitations last week.\n\nContext; my SIL (my husband’s brother’s wife) as a medical dog since she had brain cancer around 5 years ago. She has seizures where she feels dizzy 20 seconds beforehand and the goes unconscious for couple minutes. This happens 3-4 times a week. She has a dog who senses the seizure 1-2 minutes beforehand and it gives her the time to lay down in a safe place and warn people that a seizure is coming. The dog (Labrador) is an angel, but SIL, not so much. She is not a good person. She claims wrong facts about my fiancé and I’s respective fields (med and biology/environnement), and screams at us when we politely call her out. We don’t like her, but we are civil because my BIL loves her. \n\nMy own sister on the other hand is my favourite person on earth. She is my MOH.  She is very allergic to dogs. If she’s in the same room , her eyes get red and very itchy, she sneezes constantly and she has a little asthma attack. Anti-histaminic don’t work on her. She isn’t an entitled person, prefer to “sacrifice” herself than to penalize the person with the service dog. But if in the same closed room with a dog for 5 hours, she will obviously have a strong asthma attack.\n\nMe and my fiancé want my MOH to be comfortable in our wedding. And it’s shallow, but I want her to feel pretty in the pictures and not to have swollen red eyes. And we want our SIL to be safe, but we thought that with her husband always around her, she will have someone to lean on. We even proposed to bring a +1 to be there for her at all instants. And the venue is a 50 persons room so it’s not possible to have them separated enough and no backyard wedding in winter.\n\nWe wanted to announce those proposition face to face, but SIL cancelled our lunch together last minute and the invites needed to be sent, so we wrote her on messenger all our points and propositions. And we thought it was a good idea because it gave her the time to think and not feel pressured to answer our invites at the immediate moment (compared to a phone call or face to face)\n\nShe called me and screamed that I was ableist and an A\\*\\* for suggesting to remove her from her medical help, and that I want her to create a scene at our wedding and get a concussion from falling. BIL just said “what she says goes” and we don’t know what he thinks. MIL is furious and start to say she won’t come to the wedding if SIL can’t bring her dog. \n\nI know I’m biased because I obviously prefer my sister, and because I myself have (food) allergies and believe allergies should be accommodated in my wedding. \n\nWhat should I do? AITA. Is it a A\\* move of me to suggest that? \n\nEDIT: after reading some comments, i should ajust 1 thing. NO OUTDOOR WEDDING WAS POSSIBLE.  \nThe time is in the winter because MIL, BIL and SIL and others cousins travel in the USA for 3 months. So the time is only because we wanted my fiancé's family to be present.  \nthe place was chosen because it is wheelchair accessible and we have 2 persons that needs wheelchair (my grandma, my fiancé's aunt). So sadly, no it was not possible to have big spaces / outside. The place we chose was our only option in our city (and even there we went overbudget). And the place needs to be in our city and this year if i wanted my grandma to be present because of her medical treatments",

And we want our SIL to be safe, but we thought that with her husband always around her, she will have someone to lean on. We even proposed to bring a +1 to be there for her at all instants. And the venue is a 50 persons room so it’s not possible to have them separated enough and no backyard wedding in winter.We wanted to announce those proposition face to face, but SIL cancelled our lunch together last minute and the invites needed to be sent, so we wrote her on messenger all our points and propositions. And we thought it was a good idea because it gave her the time to think and not feel pressured to answer our invites at the immediate moment compared to a phone call or face to faceShe called me and screamed that I was ableist and an A\\*\\* for suggesting to remove her from her medical help, and that I want her to create a scene at our wedding and get a concussion from falling. BIL just said “what she says goes” and we don’t know what he thinks. MIL is furious and start to say she won’t come to the wedding if SIL can’t bring her dog. I know I’m biased because I obviously prefer my sister, and because I myself have food allergies and believe allergies should be accommodated in my wedding. What should I do? Am I the asshole. Is it a A\\* move of me to suggest that? EDIT: after reading some comments, i should ajust 1 thing. NO OUTDOOR WEDDING WAS POSSIBLE.  The time is in the winter because MIL, BIL and SIL and others cousins travel in the USA for 3 months. So the time is only because we wanted my fiancé's family to be present.  the place was chosen because it is wheelchair accessible and we have 2 persons that needs wheelchair my grandma, my fiancé's aunt. So sadly, no it was not possible to have big spaces / outside. The place we chose was our only option in our city and even there we went overbudget. And the place needs to be in our city and this year if i wanted my grandma to be present because of her medical treatments",

He's made some joke-not-jokes about me knitting him something for christmas, and I just... really don't want to.

On the other hand, myself and my fiance do not have a relationship with my dads current girlfriend AND she is the woman my dad had an affair with so we did not want her there. On top of that, we did not even get a congratulations text/call when we first got engaged.  I spoke to my dad recently and after telling him that we do not want her there, he took it rather personal. He began to question why my moms significant other was invited and not his, and then proceeded to say \"F you and hung up the call.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for inviting my moms significant other and not my dads? I can't seem to imagine a time or place where it would be appropriate to bring my dads mistress to my wedding.\n\nEDIT: A few ours after our phone call, my dad proceeds to text me that he will no longer be attending the wedding and sent a text saying \"wish you the best\"\n\nEDIT: Feel like I have left out some important details.

I current live in CA and the rest of my family resides in NJ so my family will be flying out for the wedding.I invited my moms current boyfriend of 10+ years because I do see him as family as he has always offered help no matter what. On the other hand, myself and my fiance do not have a relationship with my dads current girlfriend AND she is the woman my dad had an affair with so we did not want her there. On top of that, we did not even get a congratulations text/call when we first got engaged.  I spoke to my dad recently and after telling him that we do not want her there, he took it rather personal. He began to question why my moms significant other was invited and not his, and then proceeded to say \"F you and hung up the call.\"Am I the asshole for inviting my moms significant other and not my dads? I can't seem to imagine a time or place where it would be appropriate to bring my dads mistress to my wedding.EDIT: A few ours after our phone call, my dad proceeds to text me that he will no longer be attending the wedding and sent a text saying \"wish you the best\"EDIT: Feel like I have left out some important details. My father has NOT been with his current girlfriend for 14 years, thats just when my parents divorced. Also, the women he cheated with was more of a family friend, so she knew my parents were together. Yes my dad was the one in a marriage but it takes two to cheat, especially when you are fully aware the other is in a relationship.",
