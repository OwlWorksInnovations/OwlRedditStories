      "submission_post": "I (M25) have been with my fiancée Sofia (F24) since we were 20. She’s Ukrainian, and a few years back she got really close to my younger second cousin Alina (F18). Alina’s mixed Russian-American, and when they met at thanksgiving, they clicked. They like cooking together, speaking the same language, and going to church sometimes. After Alina’s mom passed away, she’s been spending a lot more time with us. Her Russian side of the family doesn’t live anywhere nearby, and there's not a big slavic community where we live.   \n  \nSo here’s the situation. Last weekend, Sofia and Alina drove out to this little bakery a couple hours away for some borodinsky bread. While they were gone, I had some of my friends over to watch the game. When the girls came back, I introduced Alina to everyone, making a point to say she's my younger cousin. She said hi, all normal. Then the storm outside picks up and we lose the sports channel. We all sat down for dinner, and one of my friends, Matt (27) makes this creepy comment directed at Alina something along the lines of \"Forget the game, I could just watch her walk around all night\"\n\nThe whole table just went silent. Alina froze. She looked so uncomfortable and awkward. And like a minute ago she was talking about being in college. \n\nI said \"What the fuck did you just say? That’s disgusting she’s 18\" He said something like \"that's legal, why are you so worked up?\" I told him point-blank \"You’re not welcome in my home anymore. Get out\" I may have also muttered something about him being a creep, but honestly at that point I didn’t care. I did also stand up and like wait for him to leave. \n\nAnyways, he left. The vibe recovered quickly everyone had a great time. A bit later, Matt puts on the chat that I publicly humiliated him for no reason, and that I was an awful friend who used this as an excuse to kick him out. He says I could have just said Alina's 18. \n\nI don't really think I over reacted. Alina looked super uncomfortable. She lost her mom recently and has been relying on us a lot. The last thing I want is her associating my house with some creepy older guy trying to hit on her. Sofia told me straight up I did the right thing, and that if we hadn’t kicked him out, the message to Alina would have been that it’s okay for men to make her uncomfortable. \n\nMatt also said I was being overprotective, and that plenty of guys would have hit on her before. TBF, I didn't like the guy that much even before, but he's apart of my group so I did have to invite them. I would have rather not. AITA? I can see how saying all of that was a bit... embarrassing for him, like unnecessarily so. Also, if another of my friends had said it I may have been a bit less harsh, idk. \n\n",

I said that I also wanted to be wearing green but would settle for blue since she had already decided. But they were both pretty against me being a princess, even if wearing a different color, their reason being that because it was couples costume for them (knight and princess) it would be weird if I also a princess. They also added that people wouldn’t be able to tell who was the couple between us. I feel like it’s not that serious. We suggested other costumes (I suggested being her lady-in-waiting, but she was very against that and they suggested I be a court jester or wizard but I would really like to wear a dress/something girly). By the end of the conversation it seemed like everyone was getting a little frustrated and my friend told me I could wear whatever I want and that it was my choice. But I’m not sure if she would still prefer me not to be a princess/be upset but me doing so. So wibta if I wore a (distinct) princess costume as well ? ",

My family mostly had legit reasons for not going like work, money, and other obligations.

Since Claire and I had both left the religion we couldn’t go. Anna could have chosen to do a public ceremony first and then the religious one after, which is pretty common within the religion, but she didn’t. I remember feeling hurt because I really wanted to be there. However, I would never take it out on her. It was her wedding and her choice.\n\nThe problem came up when my dad started ranting about Claire’s elopement. He thinks she did it as a personal slight against him. He’s still bitter because when Claire was first planning a traditional wedding she wanted her sisters to walk her down the aisle instead of him. Honestly the drama around that was part of the reason she decided to elope in the first place.\n\nI told him that to me, Claire’s choice felt similar to Anna’s wedding.

I love dogs have 2 myself and we have 3 total in the house. When J asked over a month ago I said yes as long as he was up to date on everything shots, prevention etc. He said yes he was sure. Throughout the month I asked repeatedly just to make sure. He swore up and down his dog was good to go. This  is a huge deal for my house. My owns dogs are up to date, but i have a cat in the house that cannot be medicated. Our family cat has severe medical issues. We are sure shes only alive by spite at this point. So I have this dog for less than 48 hours and find an adult flea. No big deal, he came from a wooded area. If hes on the proper meds, he bites and dies like with my dogs. Cool. I found more, I found eggs, I found live teenagers. I have since medicated the dog, bathed the dog 3x times in flea shampoo. Which is hard, he hates it. J has called his vet for the meds so I got to go pick them up for him, but I asked the front desk when his last dose was, she said 3 months ago. Hes been off medication for 2 months. Im furious at this point and tell him he has 24h to find another place for the dog or get it, trying to be gracious. He argues with me and tells me he has no one, and has subsequently spent all of his money and cant get home right now...\nSide note: I myself have immune issues, and I dont know if my current symptoms are stress or Im also allergic to fleas.",
